    <h1>Ben's Music</h1>
<p>Music made by Ben Chase over the last few years. Ben's first album was Fork 1: The Original, which entered planning stages on November 7, 2018 when 
   Ben's friend showed him an image of a plastic fork on the ground, and was released on April 14, 2019. The final album in the Fork series released on 
    January 20, 2021. I plan on continuing my music career outside of the Fork series into 2021.</p>
